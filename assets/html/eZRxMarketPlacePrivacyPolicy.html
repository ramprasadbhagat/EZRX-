</ul>

<h3>7. Product Information, Prices, Orders and Payments</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Product information: The information displayed on the Marketplace regarding any product does not constitute an offer for sale but only an invitation to treat. Sellers of a particular product on the Marketplace are solely responsible for the accuracy of information posted in respect of such product. Zuellig Pharma reserves the right in its sole discretion and without prior notice to edit or delete any information or content (including any product descriptions and prices) appearing on the Marketplace and to remove any products for sale. Except where otherwise specified, Zuellig Pharma is not the seller or supplier of the products listed on the Marketplace. Zuellig Pharma is responsible for managing and administering the Marketplace, arranging order processing and fulfillment for the products you ordered from the Sellers through the Marketplace. Your contract of sale will be entered into between the Seller and yourself, upon the Seller’s acceptance of your order.</li>
    <li>Right to refuse order: You agree that the sale of any products by a Seller is subject to availability, product withdrawal, prior sale, price change, and your compliance with the Marketplace Terms and any other agreements that you have entered into with Zuellig Pharma. Zuellig Pharma reserves the right in its sole discretion to block the sale and delivery of any classes of products at any time for any reason without any liability whatsoever to you.</li>
    <li>Orders and payments: You shall ensure that the User Access will only be used by your authorized representatives who have the authority to make any transaction through the Platform on your behalf. Any order placed or otherwise approved using the User Access shall be deemed as a valid offer issued by, and binding on, you. Subject to the Seller’s rules on cancellations, the Marketplace generally does not allow for orders to be cancelled once it has been submitted, even if the acceptance or rejection of your order is still pending. You shall acknowledge such transactions and shall fully settle all payments and costs incurred from any such transactions in accordance with the payment methods and timelines set out on the Marketplace.</li>
    <li>Acknowledgement of orders: Upon acceptance of your order by the Seller, Zuellig Pharma will provide you with an email confirmation. The confirmation will provide:
        <ul>
            <li>Details of what you have ordered, and</li>
            <li>Details of the price charged.</li>
        </ul>
        You may track your order status online. Please note that Zuellig Pharma’s confirmation will only cover the products mentioned in it and may not cover all the products you ordered. If so, then the order you have made for the remaining products will only be accepted when Zuellig Pharma sends you another separate email confirmation covering that part of your order.</li>
    <li>Deliveries: The Seller is responsible for ensuring that the product that you have ordered is delivered. Zuellig Pharma only assists the Seller with the last mile delivery of the products to your provided address. You acknowledge that the accuracy of the delivery address, timelines and condition of your ordered products are also dependent on the information provided by you and the Seller to Zuellig Pharma. Zuellig Pharma shall not be responsible for any products that are delivered late, damaged, wrong, incomplete, or in poor or damaged packaging.</li>
    <li>Zuellig Pharma may deliver the products in one or more batches. Any times and dates provided in respect of the dispatch of products or the length of time needed for delivery are only estimates. If Zuellig Pharma is unable to meet any stated dispatch or delivery dates or times, you will be informed as to the progress of your order. The products shall be, and shall be deemed to be, delivered and accepted by you when Zuellig Pharma delivers to the address provided by you and/or the Seller for delivery via the Marketplace.</li>
    <li>Returns: All returns are subject to the Seller’s returns policy. The returned product(s) must be unused and in the condition originally sold, and the packaging of such products must be in the condition in which it was delivered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>17. Relationships</h3>
<p>Zuellig Pharma will perform its obligations hereunder solely as the provider and administrator of the Marketplace. There is no other relationship whatsoever intended or created between Zuellig Pharma and you, the Seller or any other party, be it of agency, joint venture, partners, employee-employer; or franchiser-franchisee, and the like.</p>

<h3>22. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Language</h3>
<p>These Marketplace Terms and your access to and use of the Marketplace are governed by the laws of Malaysia, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia. If we provide a translation of the English language version of these Marketplace Terms (including any referenced terms, conditions, policies, notices, guidelines, rules and instructions), the English language version shall govern and take precedence in the event of any conflict.</p>
