    <p>This Privacy Policy sets out how the various entities within the Zuellig Pharma group (a non-exhaustive list of our entities is found at Part XIV (Contact Us) below) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “<b>Zuellig Pharma</b>”, “<b>our</b>”, “<b>us</b>” or “<b>we</b>”) processes personal data in accordance with the data protection laws that apply to us. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines our general practices in relation to the collection, use, disclosure (hereinafter referred to as “<b>processing</b>”) and protection of the personal data you provide through our websites, applications, platforms, forms, products, services, or social media pages or otherwise (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “<b>Platform</b>”), or when you communicate with us and/or our authorised agents through various media and communication channels. This Privacy Policy also explains your rights and the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal data. Where our Platforms deviate from this Privacy Policy or there are other specific matters, we will outline them in a specific addendum to this Privacy Policy. References to the term “Privacy Policy” herein shall include such addendum. </p>
    <p>In this Privacy Policy, “<b>personal data</b>” generally refers to any information that can be used, directly or indirectly (e.g. in combination with other types of data that we may have access to), to identify an individual (i.e. the “<b>data subject</b>”). Local data protection laws may have differing definitions of this, and to the extent that our definition used here conflicts with the law, the stricter definition will apply.</p>
    <p class="title">I.	Processing of Personal Data</p>
    <p>In the course of your dealings with us, we may process personal data about you or any other person for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. This may occur when you voluntarily provide such personal data to us, or, where necessary, we receive such personal data from third parties or from the public domain. </p>
    <p>In your interaction with us or by your usage of the Platform, we may process the following categories of personal data, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal contact information, which includes your name, mailing address, email address, social network details, or phone number; </p>

    <p>Unless prohibited by applicable laws, we will notify you before collecting your personal data, and seek your express consent if we need to collect your sensitive personal data.</p>
    <p>As the accuracy of your personal data depends largely on the information you provide to us, kindly inform us as soon as practicable if there are any errors in your personal data or if there have been changes to your personal data.</p>
    <p>If you provide us personal data about other individuals for any particular purpose, you represent and warrant to us that they have appointed you to act on their behalf and have agreed that you can:</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give consent on their behalf to the processing of their personal data;  </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive on their behalf any data protection notices; and </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warrant that you have obtained their consent for us to store their personal data, or have the right to allow us to process their personal data.</p>
    <p>Generally, as our Platform is not targeted at minors, we do not consent to receiving any personal data relating to minors. In the event that specific services provided by us require the collection and processing of minors’ personal data, this will be specifically stated in the appropriate addendum to this Privacy Policy. In such cases, we require the parent or legal guardian of such minor(s) to consent to our processing of their minor(s)’ personal data. </p>

    <p class="title">III.	Lawful Basis and Purpose of Processing Personal Data</p>
    <p>We must have a lawful basis to process personal data. We typically rely on at least one of these lawful bases to do so:</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we have the data subject’s consent for the disclosed purposes;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the processing is necessary and related to the fulfilment of a contract with the data subject or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the processing is necessary to protect vitally important interests of the data subject, including life and health;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the processing is necessary in order to respond to a national emergency, or to comply with the requirements of public order and safety; or</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, a third party or parties to whom the data is disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under local laws.</p>
    <p>We generally rely on consent to process personal data. In addition, the table below summarises some of the common purposes for which we may process personal data and our legal basis for doing so:</p>

    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;storing your personal data in systems that are protected by secured networks;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;putting in place role-based access controls to limit access to such personal data only to employees who have a need to know this information for the purpose of performing their official duties, and authorised third parties who are contractually bound to take reasonable measures to keep your personal data secure; </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regularly monitoring our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly reviewing our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organisational security measures; and </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verifying the identity of a requester before they can access or modify the personal data that they have legitimate access or modification rights to. </p>
    <p>Compliance with these provisions will be required by all authorised third parties who may access the personal data as described above.  </p>
    <p class="title">VII.	Your Rights </p>
    <p>Depending on the data protection laws in the country where you reside, in respect of the personal data which you have submitted to us, you may have the right at any time to:</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request for access to your personal data in our records; </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request to make correction of your personal data in our records in the event the information is inaccurate, misleading, out-of-date or incomplete upon validation and verification of the new information provided; </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request to cease processing your personal data for the purposes of marketing;</p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object to the processing of your personal data, request to restrict or limit processing of your personal data, or request portability of your personal data; </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withdraw your consent for us to continue processing your personal data; and </p>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lodge an inquiry or complaint to the relevant data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.</p>
    <p>Should you wish to exercise any of the abovementioned rights and such right is recognised within your country, please write in to us using the information found at Part XIV (Contact Us) below. In respect of requests for access to or to make correction of your personal data in our records, such requests must be supported with submission of the relevant documents as may be required by us. Depending on the nature and sensitivity of the request, we may require you to submit these documents in person so as to verify your identity from time to time to the address found at Part XIV (Contact Us) below. We will only make appropriate corrections based on the verifiable/verification and updated information provided by you. Your request may also be subject to payment of a fee in accordance with applicable legal requirements. </p>
    <p>With regard to the withdrawal of consent, you may withdraw, in full or in part, your consent given to us. </p>
    <p>You may request for deletion of your personal data by us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honour your request. However, please note that we may be required to keep such information and not delete it for such period of time required by law or in order to fulfil our legal obligations. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud prevention and detection or similar purposes. </p>
    <p>Your exercise of any of the rights or withdrawal of consent referred to above is, in each case, subject to any applicable legal restrictions, contractual conditions, and a reasonable time period. This may also be subject to whether it would affect the operation of our business and our ability to meet our legal obligations. </p>
    <p>We may also, in accordance with the data protection laws applicable to us, refuse to comply with your request. If we refuse to comply with such request, we will inform you of our refusal and reason for our refusal.</p>
    <p class="title">VIII.	Retention of Personal Data </p>
    <p>The personal data you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is required for the purpose for which it was collected or as permitted by applicable laws. </p>
    <p>Even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints. When we no longer need to use your personal data, it is removed from our systems and records or anonymised so that you can no longer be identified from it. </p>
    <p class="title">IX.	International Transfers of Personal Data</p>
    <p>To provide our products and services, we may transfer your personal data to our affiliates and authorised employees, agents and third parties in the jurisdictions where we operate or where we deem it appropriate or desirable (unless applicable laws provide otherwise) for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. In particular, we may transfer your personal data to our overseas affiliate(s) where our information technology storage facilities and servers may be located.  There may be a possibility that the data protection levels in other jurisdictions do not completely meet the requirements of the data protection laws in the country where you reside, but all such transfers are performed in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws. </p>
    <p class="title">X.	Links to Other Websites or Applications </p>
    <p>The Platform may contain links to and from the websites and applications of our partner networks, advertisers, patient program sponsors and/or other third parties. If you click on a link to any of these websites or applications, you will leave the Platform and be redirected to the website or application you selected. As we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same data privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of these websites or applications before providing any personal data. </p>
    <p>We may also offer you the opportunity to use your social media login. If you do so, please be aware that you share your profile information with us depending on your social media platform settings. We encourage you to visit the relevant social media platform and review its privacy policy to understand how your personal data is shared and used in this context.</p>
    <p class="title">XI.	Marketing and Promotions</p>
    <p>We may use your personal data to market products, services, events, seminars, conferences, initiatives, and promotions and talks of ours (i.e., those of our subsidiaries, related and/or associated companies), business partners, sponsors and/or advertisers. We may communicate such marketing to you by way of post, phone call, email, short message service (SMS), social media and/or any other appropriate communication channels, depending on what you have agreed to with us. If you wish to unsubscribe to the processing of your personal data for marketing and promotions, you may click on the “Unsubscribe” link in the relevant email or message you receive from us. Alternatively, you may contact us using the information found at Part XIV (Contact Us) below. Please note that once we have received your request to unsubscribe, it may take up to fourteen (14) working days for us to process your request and to be reflected in our systems. Therefore, you may still receive marketing communications during this period of time. Please also note that, even if you opt-out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order or other transaction confirmations, and other important non-marketing related announcements.  </p>
    <p class="title">XII.	Language </p>
    <p>In the event of any inconsistency between the English version and the local language version of this Privacy Policy, the English version shall prevail.  </p>
    <p class="title">XIII.	Amendments to Privacy Policy </p>
    <p>Zuellig Pharma reserves the right to modify, update and/or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will take reasonable steps to ensure amendments to this Privacy Policy are communicated by posting all amendments prominently on the Platform and other places we deem appropriate for a reasonable period of time. Amendments to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately once published on any of the Platform unless otherwise noted. We invite you to check this Privacy Policy periodically to be informed of any relevant amendments to it, especially before providing any information to us. Your continued access or usage of the Platform and/or providing your personal data to us, following any amendments to this Privacy Policy, indicates your consent to the practices described in the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you should immediately discontinue your use of the Platform, cease providing to us any of your personal data and notify us in writing in the manner described in Parts VII (Your Rights) and XIV (Contact Us). </p>
